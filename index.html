            After all there is no "I" in team<br>
            And I'd rather be normal. Yes, so normal<br>
            I suggest that we keep this informal<br>
            Cause a normal human being wouldn't need<br>
            To pretend to be normal to be normal<br>
            Well I guess that's the least that I owe ya<br>
            To be normal in a way I couldn't be<br>
            C'mon, c'mon, and love me normally<br>

        <p class="blabla" id="loveme">I was nothing before<br> so I couldn't have asked to be born<br>
            I'll be nothing again, <br>so what am I between now and then<br>
            Is there nothing to fear?<br> Cause shit's getting weird<br>
            So to God who made this man, you better have one hell of a plan<br>
            I'd rather be normal. <br>Yes, so normal<br>
            I suggest that we keep this informal<br>
            Cause a normal human being wouldn't need. No
            To pretend to be normal to be normal<br>
            Well I guess that's the least that I owe ya<br>
            To be normal in a way I could never be<br>
            C'mon, c'mon, yeah, I said c'mon, yeah<br>
            C'mon, c'mon, and love me normally<br>

    <p class="blabla" id="biov">Dame <i>Vivienne Isabel Westwood</i> is an English fashion designer and businesswoman, largely responsible for bringing modern punk and new wave fashions into the mainstream.</p>
        <p class="blabla" id="biov2"><i>Westwood</i> came to public notice when she made clothes for her and Malcolm McLaren's boutique in the King's Road, which became known as <i>SEX</i>. Their ability to synthesise clothing and music shaped the 1970s UK punk scene which was dominated by McLaren's band, the Sex Pistols. She viewed punk as a way of "seeing if one could put a spoke in the system".</p>
